# GAME 351 Assignment 1 - README

## Overview
This Unity project is part of the GAME 351 course, aimed at implementing a basic 3D game scene. The scene features an android named Jammo who has crash-landed on a medieval-themed planet. The project showcases various game development elements, including character control, terrain manipulation, and environmental detailing.

## Implemented Features

### Core Features

1. **Character Control**
   - Basic movement for the player character (forward, backward, left, right) using the WASD or arrow keys.
   - Rotation control using 'A' and 'D' or the left and right arrow keys.

2. **Follow Camera**
   - A 3rd person perspective camera that follows Jammo around, maintaining a consistent orientation relative to the character's back.

3. **Realistic Terrain**
   - The terrain includes hills, mountains, and plains, with a ring of mountains around the periphery.
   - Painted textures simulate dirt, rock, moss, grass, and include two dirt roads.

4. **Trees & Foliage**
   - Five tree prefabs placed naturally within the scene, with at least five instances of each prefab, using variations in rotation, scale, and materials.

5. **Baron's Castle**
   - A castle created using ProBuilder, featuring outer walls, an inner keep, doorways, windows, a gate, and archer firing ports.

### Choice Features

6. **Crash Site**
   - A crash site for Jammoâ€™s ship with a spacecraft model, perturbed terrain to create a crater, and painted scorch marks.
   - Added debris objects around the crash site to enhance realism.

## Known Issues
- No enemies added to the scene.
- No farms added to the scene.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Setup Unity Project**
   - Launch Unity Hub and select "Create new project".
   - Ensure all necessary packages and plugins used in the project are installed.
   - Open the "Package Manager" in the Unity Editor and verify all packages are correctly installed.

2. **Import Project Files**
   - Unzip the project folder and open it in Unity.

3. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - This project uses Unity's Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP).

## Controls

- **Movement:** WASD or arrow keys.
- **Rotation:** 'A' and 'D' or left and right arrow keys.

## Additional Information

- **Game Assets:** The project uses a mix of provided and downloaded assets from the Unity Asset Store. All assets are documented within the project files.
- **Tutorial References:** For terrain texturing and using ProBuilder, the following tutorials were referenced:
  - [Texturize Terrains with Materials](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/texturize-terrains-with-materials)
  - [ProBuilder House Tutorial](http://www.procore3d.com/pb-house-tutorial/)

## Testing

- Ensure the project runs in a fresh install by testing it in a new Unity project directory to confirm all elements work as expected.
